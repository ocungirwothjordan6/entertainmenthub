        <h2>"Emergency funding runs out in September," Dominique Hyde, the agency's Director for External Relations, said in a statement.</h2>
        <p><strong>Published:</strong> August 7, 2025</p>
        <p>The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has issued a warning that emergency funding to assist refugees in Uganda will run out by September 2025 unless additional support is received. The funding crisis threatens relief programs for nearly 1.93 million refugees, most of whom are children fleeing conflicts in Sudan, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

        <h3>Current Situation</h3>
        <p>Uganda, already hosting the largest refugee population in Africa, continues to receive about 600 new arrivals daily. The number is expected to reach 2 million by the end of the year. UNHCR can currently meet only one-third of the needs of Sudanese refugees and will be forced to reduce individual monthly support from $16 to $5 without additional funding.</p>
        <p>"More children will die of malnutrition, more girls will fall victim to sexual violence, and families will be left without shelter or protection unless the world steps up."</p>
        <p>UNHCR and other UN agencies face one of the worst funding crises in decades, compounded by U.S. and other donor states' decisions to slash foreign aid funding.</p>
        <p>Uganda is home to 1.93 million refugees, more than a million of them under 18, according to UNHCR figures.</p>
        <p>An average of 600 people are still coming in every day and the overall figure, already the largest in Africa, is due to rise to 2 million by the end of the year, the agency says.</p>
        <p>It said it would only be able to meet a third of the costs associated with supporting Sudanese refugees in Uganda - and would have to cut its monthly funding to $5 per refugee from $16 unless more money is found.</p>
        <p>Malnutrition rates are rising as food, water, and medicine supplies shrink, while the risk of suicide is increasing among young refugees due to a reduction in mental health staff, the agency added.</p>

        <h3>Consequences of Funding Shortage</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Increased malnutrition among refugees</li>
          <li>Reduced access to food, water, and medicine</li>
          <li>Heightened mental health challenges and suicide risks</li>
          <li>Potential rise in deaths, sexual violence, and loss of shelter</li>
        </ul>
